* # How I Built this Project?
1.Firstly I visualized basic layout and created containers according to the layout.
2.Then I created Basic HTML structure.
3.Then I paused and thought all possible features I could add (I leveraged AI for suggesting features and keywords to search in browser about these features)
4.Then I started building the JS while exploring browser storage features..
5.After 15days of building and debugging with blood-sweat-tears I got the fucntionality up!
6.Finally added and fixed css. 
7.see my commit history to know my pain.*

Just kidding :) it was really exciting!
